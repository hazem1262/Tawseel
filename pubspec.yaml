  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - resources/langs/
    - assets/
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 500
    - family: Almarai
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai-Light.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai-Regular.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 500
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
