  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - resources/langs/
    - assets/apple-icon.png
    - assets/fullname-icon.png
    - assets/google-icon.png
    - assets/intro-image.png
    - assets/logo-splash.png
    - assets/password-icon.png
    - assets/password-visability.png
    - assets/phone-icon.png

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
